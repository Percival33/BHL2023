This is the repository of team **Ale to Ty Dzwonisz?!** from the hackathon [BEST Hacking League](https://www.facebook.com/BESTHACKINGLEAGUE/) organized by [BEST (Board of European Students of Technology) Warsaw](https://new.best.warszawa.pl/).

We have developed the "Magazyn 4.0" project aimed at optimizing warehouse operations. We invite you to explore our solutions and features described in more detail in the following documentation.

Our team significantly stood out among others during the hackathon, which is why we took **third place**. The final presentation and documentation are in Polish, but we still invite you to familiarize yourself with them.

## Technologies

Our team utilized:

-   `React Native` for the end-user mobile application, supporting barcode scanning, reporting issues, and handling orders using websockets
    
-   `React` for creating a warehouse manager dashboard
    
-   `MongoDB` for storing data on warehouse products, their location, quantity, and for managing orders
